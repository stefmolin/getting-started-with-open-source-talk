## Abstract

The open source community is all about giving back and learning from one another. No matter how small, every contribution is valuable. And everyone can contribute something with a little bit of help. The hardest part is finding something to work on that fits your interests and skills.

In this talk, I will provide five ways that I used to get started contributing to different open source projects. I also share some guidance on selecting projects to contribute to and how to set yourself up for success. Get ready to start your open source journey!
