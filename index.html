          <h2>Myth #1</h2>
          <h3>
            Only professional developers or maintainers can contribute to open
            source projects.
          </h3>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              Open source projects are built by the community, for the
              community, and you would be hard-pressed to find a project that
              doesn't welcome help of some form. People of all levels can
              contribute to open source projects.
            </p>
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Myth #2</h2>
          <h3>Only experts can contribute something meaningful.</h3>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              There is room for people to contribute in a variety of ways. As a
              non-expert, your experience with the project will be different
              than that of a seasoned maintainer, and this is tremendously
              helpful because the experts will have a lot more trouble
              understanding what matters to people who aren't experts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Think about it &ndash; what's more meaningful to a newcomer:
              better documentation about getting started or a new advanced
              feature?

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              Finding something to work on is often the hardest part of
              contributing to open source, especially, if you are only
              considering code contributions as your options. However, there are
              many other ways to contribute <em>e.g.</em>, improving or
              translating documentation, making tutorials, building community,
              and reporting bugs.

                <b>Which license is the software distributed with?</b> Your
                employer may have restrictions on your participation depending
                on the license.

                  the project was last updated/released?</b
                >
                The project may be very mature, and therefore light on activity.
                <b>Are people still using it?</b>
                If not, the project may have been abandoned or replaced. In
                either case, try to find something else.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>How big is the codebase?</b> While there will likely be more
                opportunities for contributions in a larger codebase, it may be
                harder to get a foothold if you are newer to the codebase.

              <li>
                <b

                  familiar with?</b
                >
                If so, you can use that knowledge to contribute even if you are
                less familiar with this project's codebase. Example: Seaborn is
                built on top of Matplotlib, so if you know Matplotlib, you can
                tackle some issues in Seaborn.

                  public?</b
                >
                If not, then this isn't an option. Keep in mind that not
                everything is hosted on GitHub.

              <li>
                While working on scikit-learn, I learned about numpydoc, which I

              <li>
                The maintainers also helped me fix some issues I was having by
                introducing me to pre-commit. This also led me to several other
                contributions with other projects.
              </li>
              <li>
                It was a great experience, and I have done multiple sprints
                since. I can't recommend them enough. Regardless of your
                experience, you can learn something.

                Pick a project that interests you, as this will motivate you to
                make your contribution and set you up for further contributions
                after the sprint.
              </li>
              <li>
                Maintainers will mention if they are able to support beginners.
                This could mean a beginner to programming or just to that
                project.
              </li>
              <li>
                Maintainers curate a set of issues for the sprint and help
                people contribute. Be sure to use them as a resource &ndash;
                they want to see you make a contribution just as much as you
                want to make one.
              </li>
              <li>
                A sprint is a tremendous opportunity to meet and learn from
                maintainers. Ask them questions. What development tools do they
                use? How do they navigate the codebase? Depending on the project
                and your experience, you may also be able to teach them some
                things.

                Look for tags such as <b>beginner</b>, <b>easy</b>, or

                comments as these are likely just the description of the task.
                In GitHub, you can see this from the listing of issues, which
                saves you time compared to opening each issue individually.
                Another option is to use sites like

                Older issues may have less action, but may still be relevant. Be
                sure to ask the maintainers. I've had success with this on
                Seaborn. I found an old issue that I knew how to do, and I asked
                if it was still of interest. This led to a PR for the reference
                line functionality on grid plots (FacetGrid and JointPlot).
              </li>
              <li>
                Check for meta-issues. These are issues that list a set of
                desired changes that should be performed on multiple areas of
                the codebase. Often, this means you have a template to follow.
                These are common for sprints.
              </li>
              <li>
                Comment on the issue if you are interested in working on it. You
                can also ask the maintainers for clarifications here.

                Once you have found something that you would like to work on,
                make sure you claim it (<em>e.g.</em>, by commenting on the
                issue). This keeps the maintainers in the loop (so they can help
                you if needed) and prevents duplication of efforts.

              <li>
                Make sure to follow any setup instructions the project provides
                for contributors. This may be in the documentation or in a
                contributing guide in the repository. If the instructions don't
                work for you, you can also fix that.

              <li>
                If you are completely new to development, start with

              <li>
                Remember to be kind and patient in all your interactions with a
                project. Many maintainers are doing this outside of their
                regular work &ndash; it might take some time for them to review
                everything.

              Be sure to keep your eyes open for opportunities of
              cross-pollination: something you are exposed to while working on
              one project may be something that another project wants to
              implement.

            <p>
              Take a look at the open PRs. If you see something needs to be
              fixed, feel free to comment on it. This is also a great way to get
              noticed by the maintainers if you are interested in joining them.

            <p>
              Your dedication will not go unnoticed. Maintainers will start to
              remember your name, and you may also be able to meet them in
              person at other events. I've met maintainers from Matplotlib and
              pandas at EuroSciPy 2023 after previously interacting with them on
              GitHub. Sticking with it can even lead to an invitation to become
              a maintainer, which was how I became a numpydoc core developer.
