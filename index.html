          <h2>Myth #1</h2>
          <h3>
            Only professional developers or maintainers can contribute to open
            source projects.
          </h3>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              Open source projects are built by the community, for the
              community, and you would be hard-pressed to find a project that
              doesn't welcome help of some form. People of all levels can
              contribute to open source projects.
            </p>
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Myth #2</h2>
          <h3>Only experts can contribute something meaningful.</h3>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              There is room for people to contribute in a variety of ways. As a
              non-expert, your experience with the project will be different
              than that of a seasoned maintainer, and this is tremendously
              helpful because the experts will have a lot more trouble
              understanding what matters to people who aren't experts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Think about it &ndash; what's more meaningful to a newcomer:
              better documentation about getting started or a new advanced
              feature?

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              Finding something to work on is often the hardest part of
              contributing to open source, especially, if you are only
              considering code contributions as your options. However, there are
              many other ways to contribute <em>e.g.</em>, improving
              documentation, making tutorials, building community, and reporting
              bugs.

                something else.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>How big is the codebase?</b> While there will likely be more
                opportunities for contributions in a larger codebase, it may be
                harder to get a foothold if you are newer to the codebase.

                  familiar with?</b
                >
                If so, you can use that knowledge to contribute even if you are
                less familiar with this project's codebase. Example: Seaborn is
                built on top of Matplotlib, so if you know Matplotlib, you can
                tackle some issues in Seaborn.

                  public?</b

              Hopefully, some of the projects you brainstormed are suitable.

              Sifting through a project's issues can be overwhelming due to the
              volume of issues, but knowing how to search helps significantly:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Look for tags such as <b>beginner</b>, <b>easy</b>, or
                <b>good first issue</b>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Try to find issues with few (or no) comments as these are likely
                just the description of the task. In GitHub, you can see this
                from the listing of issues, which saves you time compared to
                opening each issue individually.
              </li>
              <li>
                Older issues may have less action, but may still be relevant. Be
                sure to ask the maintainers.
              </li>
              <li>
                Check for meta-issues. These are issues that list a set of
                desired changes that should be performed on multiple areas of
                the codebase. Often, this means you have a template to follow.
                These are common for sprints.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Comment on the issue if you are interested in working on it. You
              can also ask the maintainers for clarifications here.
